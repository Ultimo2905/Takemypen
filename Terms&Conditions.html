                Limitation of Liability
            </h5>
            <p>
                Upon acceptance of the above Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, the Customer willingly agrees not to hold the Company and its shareholders, employees, officers, representatives, agents, affiliates, 
                directors, advertising and fulfillment agencies, subsidiaries, promotion, any third-party providers or sources of information or data and legal advisers (the “Company’s Affiliates”) liable for any and all losses,

            <h5>
               Refund Policy 
            </h5>
            
            <p>
                If we fail to meet the deadline, the customers are eligible to request the refund of their  payment. We would like our customers to have in mind that no refund can be issued if the delivery delay 
                is caused by the late upload of the necessary materials for order completion.
            </p>
            <p>
                We guarantee our customers a refund if the order delivery is late and has occurred due to the company’s delay (although it happens in very rare cases). The refund request must be submitted no later
                than ten days after the order is completed. The claims that come in after this time-frame will not be considered by our Dispute Department. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
               If the order delivery is caused by our company, the customer is eligible to request a partial refund for lateness. Our Dispute Department will calculate the refund amount according to the initially
               set deadline and the deadline within which the order was delivered, and will reimburse a customer a corresponding amount. For example if a 24-hour order is delivered late, it will fall into the category
               of the orders with the 48-hour deadline and consequently will cost less. Therefore, the difference between the prices for the 24-hour deadline and 48-hour deadline will be reimbursed respectively. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Although the refund claims from our customers are not frequent, it is always important to have our clients reassured that they will receive the requested work of high quality. If our customer is not
               satisfied with the service because the initial instructions provided were not met, or the work is not delivered on time, the customer has the right to request a refund by addressing our Dispute Department.
               If the customer claims that the paper is poorly written, they have a right to request a refund provided he or she submits sufficient proof of the low quality of the paper. Please note that in case of the 
               full refund, the completed work is published online and cannot be used as the genuine work. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
               The customer might request to cancel the order at any stage of the order completion, however, please note that the reimbursed amount will be calculated according to the different factors and conditions of
               the cancellation request. If the writer has not been assigned to the order yet and thus the order has not been yet started, a customer might be eligible for a full refund (100%). However, the Dispute Manager
               will evaluate the amount of work and efforts put into processing an order. In this case, the full refund cannot be provided. If the writer has already been assigned to the order, then the reimbursed amount will
               depend on the deadline that has already passed since a customer placed the order and the quantity of work already completed by an expert. If a customer requests to cancel the order before or when a half of the
               deadline has passed, they are eligible for up to 50% of the refund. If they request their order to be canceled after a half of the deadline has passed, the refund amount they can receive is up to 30%. We ask them 
               to understand that a professional who has been asked to work on their task needs to be awarded for the amount of work they have completed before their cancellation request.  
            </p>
            
            <h5>
               If no writer has been assigned to the order. 
            </h5>
            
            <p>
               After a customer places an order with our service, the rest of its completion process will be of our responsibility. Our Support Team is to rapidly assign the most suitable writer to complete the customer’s work,
               however, if the expert with the proper qualification for the order is not found (although it happens rarely), or our writers are overloaded, we guarantee our customers a full refund of their payment.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In case of the revision request that a customer wants to be completed by a new writer and an appropriate one for their revision is not found, the Dispute Department will decide on their refund request under individual terms.
